middlewares---->configartion--->debugging----->templating enginesss


middlewares:
1)core concepts of the express
2)middleware or middleware functions are nothing but takes 
request object and return a response to the request to it 
or else it will pass control to another middleware function

example of middleware function:
router handle functions are one of the example of it 
app.get("/",(req,res)=>{
    //call back function is one of the middleware in express 
})
example-2:
app.use(express.json())
-->express.json() function is also a built in  middleware function where it will try to search for json object from body
and parse into a json object with the name of req.body 
--> after doing it , it will next head over to router() -->route handler function and after response from it
--> response response pipeline gets ended

--> we can make our own middlewares, it will gets added in the front of the response process pipeline

morgan

->actually morgon is a third party middle ware
npm i morgan

const morgan = require("morgan")

app.use(morgan('tiny'))

when every time we send request to any of the endpoint in the server ,
the morgan middleware will log information about the request in the log
it will be very helpfull in track of the request and response and also it very easy for debuggig purpose
